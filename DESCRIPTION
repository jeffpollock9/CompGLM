Description: A function (which uses a similar interface to the `glm' function)
    for the fitting of a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson GLM. There are also various
    methods for analysis of the model fit. The package also contains functions
    for the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution in a similar interface to
    functions `dpois', `ppois' and `rpois'. The functions are generally quick,
    since the workhorse functions are written in C++ (thanks to the Rcpp
    package).
