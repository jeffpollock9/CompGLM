Title: Conway-Maxwell-Poisson GLM and distribution functions
Version: 1.0
Date: 2014-07-01

Description: The package contains a function (which uses a similar interface to
    the `glm' function) for the fitting of a Conway-Maxwell-Poisson GLM. There
    are also various methods for analysis of the model fit. The package also
    contains functions for the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution in a similar
    interface to functions `dpois', `ppois' and `rpois'. The functions are
    generally quick, since the workhorse functions are written in C++ (thanks
    to the Rcpp package).
